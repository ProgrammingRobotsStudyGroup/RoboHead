# RoboHead
Robot head and control panel.
The idea is that this can act both as a part of the robot or be removable. While this could/should talk to ROS master, it probably shouldn't be a master.

## (Potential) Objectives
* Displays a face which can talk, etc. This need not mimic humans.
* Speech synthesis (talk, sing, etc.)
* Sound generation
* Speech recognition
* Diagnostics and status panels
* Integrate with ROS
